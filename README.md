# PEXTUnion
Cleaner &amp; Extractor for PEUnion (tested on PEunion 3.1.5)

# Is able to
- Decrypt all strings
- Extract protected application(s)
- Fix variables, methods & classes names

(Even works with all protections activated!)

# Notes
if the protected application downloads the payload from a URL, PEXTUnion will not work (this will be fix in future updates)

(This is an improved version of my original PEunion Unpacker, which was a pain to use)
